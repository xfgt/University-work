# University work

A repository that extends the workfield of the exercises from my university.
As in the previous case, where I had <a href="https://github.com/xfgt/OldProjects">my work from the first and second semester</a>, here in this repository It's meant to keep track of the work from the 3rd and 4th semesters respectively.
